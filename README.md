My name is Sven and I am a DevOps and Platform Engineering Trainer.

After studying software engineering at Ulm University, I first started to work as a full stack web developer and DevOps Engineer at [Team Parallax](https://team-parallax.com). 
As part of my journey at TPX, I transitioned into project and education management, where I gained first insights into being responsible for a team of developers. 

Over time I realized there could be so much more to do to help others to evolve as software engineers and reach their next level, so I decided to found my first own company named SPMSEC.

Since founding SPMSEC in 2023 this is what we (the team of freelancers and I) achieved together on our mission to help people grow:

- 75+ trainings/workshops given (may '25)
- 450+ people reached
- 3 different learning paths and more to come

I always had the idea to build my own SaaS solution to support and scale what I was already doing: Providing immersive and interactive training experiences all around web, cloud, devops, or automation.

That is why my cofounder an I created the newest company named **SK Tech GmbH** where we are building NEURONITY - our Education-as-a-Service Platform.
